SOS-Op-Sys-Simulation
=====================
Developed a simulation of an interrupt driven operating system in C++, that compiled alongside an object file provided by the professor. Tasks included storing new jobs into various data structures and loading them into our free space table that represented physical memory. CPU scheduling algorithms were used to optimize CPU utilization percentage.
